# food

A project I made to solve the ancient problem of not being able to decide where to eat with your significant other. 

The project uses React, Redux and the Google Places API to generate a list of the 20 closest restaurants to your current location that you can then sort through with your partner systematically.

## Installation

Install the packages and run the project using:

```bash
1. npm install

2. Get a Google Places API key below and insert it into the fetch on the file 'RestaurantAPI.js':

3. npm start
```
The project is also hosted here: https://food-solver.netlify.app/ in case you don't want to through the hassle of getting a key.
